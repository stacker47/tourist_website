            <h3>History of Khajuraho Group of Monuments, Madhya Pradesh:</h3>

                    The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a stunning collection of ancient temples located in the Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India.

                    <br>

                    <strong>Origins:</strong> The construction of the Khajuraho temples is believed to have started during the reign of the Chandela dynasty, which ruled the region between the 10th and 12th centuries. The exact history and purpose behind the construction of these temples remain a subject of scholarly debate.

                    <strong>Chandela Dynasty:</strong> The Chandela rulers, who were known for their patronage of art and architecture, are credited with the construction of these temples. It is believed that over 85 temples were originally built, spread across an area of approximately 20 square kilometers. However, today, only around 20 temples have survived the ravages of time and are well-preserved.

                    <strong>Architectural Marvel:</strong> The temples of Khajuraho showcase a blend of Nagara-style and Dravidian-style architecture. They are predominantly made of sandstone, and the complex carvings on the walls depict scenes from mythology, celestial beings, erotic sculptures, musicians, dancers, animals, and daily life during the medieval period.

                    <strong>Rediscovery:</strong> Over time, the Khajuraho temples were gradually abandoned and became engulfed by vegetation and forests. They remained hidden from the world until they were rediscovered by a British surveyor named T.S. Burt in the mid-19th century.
