            <h3>History of Mahabodhi Temple Complex, Bihar:</h3>
            
                <p>
                    The Mahabodhi Temple Complex, located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, is one of the most important and revered Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the world. It is associated with the life of Prince Siddhartha Gautama, who later became known as Gautama Buddha, and marks the spot where he attained enlightenment.

                    <br>

                    <strong>Origins:</strong> The history of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex dates back to approximately 260 BCE when Emperor Ashoka, the Mauryan ruler, visited Bodh Gaya and erected a simple shrine at the site. It was during his visit that Buddhism began to gain prominence and the site became a significant religious center.

                    <strong>Great Temple Construction:</strong> The current Mahabodhi Temple, which is the central structure of the complex, was built during the Gupta period in the 5th to 6th centuries CE. The temple stands on the same spot where it is believed that Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. The architecture of the temple complex is a fine example of Indian brickwork and Gupta-style architecture.
